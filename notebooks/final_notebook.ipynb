    "**Author:** Soura Biswal \n",
    "**Course:** Natural Language Processing & Generative AI - University of San Diego  \n",
    "**Deliverable:** Final Project — Code Notebook  \n",

    "**Short summary:**  \n",
    "FinAgentX is a modular, multi-agent pipeline that ingests financial news and market data, classifies and extracts key facts (EPS, revenue), summarizes articles, routes them to specialist agents (earnings & macro), evaluates outputs, and refines the results. The notebook demonstrates the full system end-to-end using lightweight, free tools (Python, yfinance, and a small Kaggle-derived dataset).\n",

    "**Objective:** Build an agentic system that can research stocks and provide structured, explainable research notes by combining news and market signals.  \n",
    "**Primary learning goals:** agent orchestration, prompt-chaining workflows, routing to specialists, evaluator→optimizer loops, and simple persistent memory.\n",

    "**Deliverables demonstrated in this notebook:**\n",
    "- Data ingestion (prices + news)\n",
    "- Prompt chaining (preprocess → classify → extract → summarize)\n",
    "- Routing to EarningsAgent and MarketAgent\n",
    "- Evaluator + Optimizer loop\n",

    "**Source:** Kaggle – Financial News Sentiment Dataset (Lightweight Version)  \n",
    "**Size:** Approximately ~15MB  \n",
    "**Variables:**  \n",
    "- `id`: Unique identifier for news entry  \n",
    "- `title`: News headline  \n",
    "- `content`: Full news article text  \n",
    "- `sentiment`: Label such as Positive, Negative, Neutral  \n",
    "- `ticker`: Related company (e.g., AAPL, TSLA)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample Data Stored:**  \n",
    "- `data/sample/` → 5–10 news articles per ticker (AAPL, TSLA)  \n",
    "- `data/sample/*.csv` → price snapshots from `yfinance`  \n",
    "- `data/memory/memory.json` → stores model run history and evaluation feedback\n",

    "**High-level flow:**\n",

    "1. **Fetcher**: Collects price data (yfinance) and sample news (local JSON from `data/sample/`).  \n",
    "2. **Preprocessor**: cleans text, normalizes dates.  \n",
    "3. **Classifier**: rule-based classifier (earnings / macro / news).  \n",
    "4. **Extractor**: regex rules to extract EPS, revenue, and presence flags.  \n",
    "5. **Summarizer**: templates that produce short and long summaries + sentiment.  \n",
    "6. **Router**: routes article to specialized agents (earnings, market).  \n",
    "7. **Specialists**: context-specific logic (e.g., earnings compare).  \n",
    "8. **Evaluator**: heuristic scoring (factuality, completeness, clarity).  \n",
    "9. **Optimizer**: one-step refinement based on feedback.  \n",
    "10. **Memory store**: JSON file storing per-run notes for learning across runs.\n",
