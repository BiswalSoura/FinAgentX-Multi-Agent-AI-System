## Project Overview

**FinAgentX** is a **multi-agent AI system** designed to perform automated **financial news analysis** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and lightweight generative logic.  
It simulates how multiple “specialized agents” (like analysts) would collaborate to read, summarize, and interpret market data, news, and company performance reports.

The system works on a **small dataset** that runs efficiently on a **CPU machine**, with minimal dependencies.  
It demonstrates prompt-chaining, routing, self-evaluation, and iterative refinement without requiring any paid APIs or GPUs.

### Key Capabilities
- Automatically read and classify financial articles.
- Extract important metrics such as **EPS**, **Revenue**, and **Market Reactions**.
- Generate **short and long summaries** for human-like explanations.
- Route news to specialized agents: *EarningsAgent* and *MarketAgent*.
- Evaluate and refine output quality through self-assessment.
- Store results and learning memory for continuous improvement.
- Export final reports in JSON or notebook format for submission.

## Environment Setup

### Step 1 — Create Virtual Environment

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
cd "<path-to-repo>"
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt


### Step 2 - Running the System

Activate environment (as shown above).
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook
2. Open notebooks/final_notebook.ipynb.
3. Run all cells (top to bottom).

The notebook will:
- Read Fin_Cleaned.csv and sample news files.
- Fetch 1-month price history for AAPL & TSLA (using yfinance).
- Process articles via classifier → extractor → summarizer.
- Route content to Earnings or Market agent.
- Evaluate output quality.
- Save the refined outputs to:
    data/sample/out/analysis_end2end.json
    data/memory/memory.json

Dataset Description :
Primary Dataset:

File: data/Fin_Cleaned.csv
Source: Derived from a Kaggle financial sentiment dataset.

Columns Expected:

Column	Description
Headline	Article title
Synopsis	Short abstract or summary
Full_text	Main body of the article
Date_published	Date of publication
Final Status	Human-labeled sentiment
Supporting Files:
        File	                        Description	                   Created By
news_AAPL.json	                5–10 sample AAPL news articles	    Created manually
news_TSLA.json	                5–10 sample TSLA news articles	    Created manually
AAPL_prices_1mo_YYYYMMDD.csv	1-month AAPL price data	            Auto-generated by notebook
TSLA_prices_1mo_YYYYMMDD.csv	1-month TSLA price data	            Auto-generated by notebook


Core Components :
    Module	                 Description
classifier.py	    Classifies article as earnings/macro/news
extractor.py	    Extracts EPS, revenue, and related metrics
summarizer.py	    Generates short and long summaries
earnings_agent.py	Analyzes earnings articles for financial impact
market_agent.py	    Handles market-related articles
evaluator.py	    Evaluates article analysis accuracy
optimizer.py	    Refines output based on evaluator feedback
orchestrator.py	    Orchestrates all agents in sequence
router.py	        Routes articles to the appropriate agent
cache.py	        Saves and retrieves analysis memory


Documentation :

Quick Start (also in documentation/quick_start.md)
Create and activate virtual environment.
Install dependencies (pip install -r requirements.txt).
Place Fin_Cleaned.csv in /data/.
Generate sample JSON files in /data/sample/.
Run the notebook and review output.
Output will be available in:
    /data/sample/out/analysis_end2end.json
    /data/memory/memory.json


How FinAgentX Works (Step-by-Step)

Input:
Loads news articles (AAPL, TSLA) and stock prices from CSV.

Classification:
classifier.py determines if the article is about earnings, market events, or general finance.

Extraction:
extractor.py pulls numerical and factual data (EPS, revenue, etc.).

Summarization:
summarizer.py produces both a short and detailed summary with sentiment polarity.

Routing:
Based on classification, articles are sent to specialized agents:

EarningsAgent: Interprets quarterly results.

MarketAgent: Identifies macroeconomic signals.

Evaluation & Optimization:
evaluator.py scores the summary quality.
optimizer.py refines the text when the score is low.

Memory Update:
Final outputs are stored in /data/memory/memory.json to simulate persistent learning.

Output:
Cleaned, summarized, and evaluated results exported to /data/sample/out/analysis_end2end.json.

Troubleshooting :

        Issue	                             Possible Fix
yfinance fetch fails	     Run with Internet or disable price fetch section
Missing CSV	                 Ensure Fin_Cleaned.csv is in /data/
Notebook kernel crash	     Reduce number of articles in JSON sample
Module import errors	     Ensure repo root added to PYTHONPATH or use relative imports
PDF export fails	         Export HTML first, then print to PDF
